## Intro <a name="intro"></a>

Chrome extension for Airtable adding OpenAI GPT based code hints to Airtable formula field.

This extension utilizes OpenAI GPT-3 (model "text-davinci-003") to provide code hints for Airtable formula fields. It plugs into the Airtable formula editor (based on Monaco editor) and provides code hint based on the prompt provided by the user inside the field.

The prompt is wrapped in an extra set of instructions before being sent to OpenAI GPT-3. The intention is to simplify the prompt and make sure the OpenAI response is provided in format of Airtable formula. The prompt is wrapped in the following format:

Regular Completions Mode

```
I want to generate Airtable formula that will do following:
${userPrompt}

Make sure the response is a valid Airtable formula.
```

ChatGPT Completions Mode

```
    {
      role: "system",
      content:
        "You are a bot providing Airtable formulas. Respond with a formulas only and nothing else. No additional explanation is needed, only a valid Airtable formula without quotation marks.",
    },
    { role: "user", content: userPrompt },
```

The prompt is sent to OpenAI with following parameters:

- "max_tokens" set to 3500 to provide sufficient room for longer prompts
- "temperature" as adjusted by user in the extension settings, defaults to 0.2
- "model"
  - Regular Completions Mode "text-davinci-003". Based on tests the "codex" models were performing worse than "davinci" model.
  - ChatGPT Completions Mode "gpt-3.5-turbo" which should point to the latest updated version of chat model.

## Extension Stack <a name="extension_stack"></a>

The base for this extension was forked from [Jonghakseo/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react-vite](https://github.com/Jonghakseo/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react-vite#intro) and modified to fit the needs of this extension.

The core difference was adding Tailwind CSS. To avoid clashes with Airtable CSS, the extension is using shadow DOM to encapsulate the extension UI. To enable Tailwind inside of shadow DOM I am using Twind,
which converts Tailwind into classes at runtime.

The Hint GPT button is inserted into the Airtable UI, using some ugly JQuery.
